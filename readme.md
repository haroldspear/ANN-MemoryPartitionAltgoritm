# Project Title

Artificial Neural Network, to find the best memory partitioning algorithm.


## Getting Started

We use python 3.6.6 and Keras to build the neural network, you can use a global or virtual environment.

### Prerequisites

You need python.

To work on a virtual environment you can use software like Anaconda, but a simple solution is using virtualenvwrapper

```
  pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

### Installing

To work in virtual environment, create:
```
  mkvirtualenv envname
```

Use:
```
  workon envname
```

Install requirements:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

```
  python main_k.py
```
Use menu options, split dataset, define model, load model, train and evaluate and predict.
